# compiler-py

This is my attempt at translating Jack W. Crenshaw's [Let's Build A
Compiler!](http://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/tutor1.txt) series into Python
code.

# Design Decisions

I tried to keep the code as one-to-one with the original Pascal code from the
book, although this leads to some code layout that looks somewhat ugly to me. I
might go back after this is done and refactor some things when I have a greater
understanding of the codebase.

Also, I'm sticking with 68000 assembly until it's finished -- I might translate
into x86 assembly later.
